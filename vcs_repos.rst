General Guidelines
==================

* People in the group are free to push changes to ``main`` branches,
  or use feature branches and GitHub pull requests as they see fit.
  External contributors should fork repos and create pull requests to provide changes so that they are reviewed.

* All repos have issue trackers on GitHub.
  Please use the issue trackers to report bugs,
  suggest changes,
  etc.

* Please *do not* use GitHub wikis.
  Instead,
  please write documentation into :file:`docs` repos,
  or in the :file:`docs/` directories of Python package repos.

* Docs use Sphinx_

  .. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/

* Docs from public repos will be rendered as HTML on readthedocs.org.

* There is no provision for rendering docs from private repos.
