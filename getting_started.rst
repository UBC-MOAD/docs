Getting Started
***************

This section is for people joining the MOAD group.
It's mostly a collection of links to other places in these and other docs in approximately the order that you need to do things to get up and running in the group.

There's lots to learn as you join the group,
but you can also help us improve things right from Day 1.
You are reading these docs with eyes and brain that haven't looked at them before,
so you are uniquely qualified to see things that other people take for granted.
Please help us improve our docs fixing typos,
improving wording,
etc. by using the :guilabel:`Edit on GitHub` link in the upper right corner of every page
(on a desktop browser - sadly that feature is not available at the moment on phones and tablets).
If you find something that you don't feel confident fixing,
please create an issue about it in the `issue tracker on GitHub`_.

Here's the Getting Started checklist:

#. :ref:`GetYourEOASEmailAddressAndUserId`
#. :ref:`GetSetUpOnGitHub`
#. :ref:`SetUpSecureRemoteAccess`
#. :ref:`SetUpGit`
#. :ref:`SetUpBash`
#. :ref:`InstallMiniforge`

.. _GetYourEOASEmailAddressAndUserId:

Get Your EOAS Email Address and User Id
=======================================

Susan will take you through the form to get your EOAS email address and Linux computer user id setup during your first meeting with her when you join the group.


.. _GetSetUpOnGitHub:

Get Set Up on GitHub
====================

If you don't already have an account on `GitHub`_,
please create one.
Then,
send your GitHub username to Doug at ``dlatornell@eoas.ubc.ca``.
He will add you to the `UBC-MOAD GitHub organization`_ and you will receive an invitation email from GitHub that you will have to accept in order to finalize your addition to the organization.
Doug will probably also invite you to at least one of the other project-specific :ref:`GitHub organizations<team-repos>` that we have.
